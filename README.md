# 🚆 MITHRA – Agentic AI + RAG Powered Multilingual Voice Assistant for Chennai Metro  

MITHRA is an **AI-powered, agentic, multilingual voice bot system** that leverages **Gemini LLM** and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** for **metro passenger guidance** and **autonomous ticket booking**. It offers **multilingual voice support in Tamil, English, and Hindi**, making the metro more accessible to a wider commuter base.  

The system follows a **multi-agent architecture** with two specialized agents:  
- 🚇 **Passenger Guidance Agent** – provides route planning, station facilities, and navigation support  
- 🎟️ **Ticket Booking Agent** – autonomously books tickets, simulates payment, and generates QR codes  

This project was **co-developed over 4 months** as part of an **IT internship with Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL)** and officially submitted to **Anna University** as our **final-year industry project**.
